  '**“The Want, Will, and Hopes of the People.”**\n' +
  '\n' +
  '— The Declaration of Independence.\n' +
  '\n' +
  '  We, the undersigned Free TON Community, Validators and Developers, hereby\n' +
  'announce the launch of Free TON Blockchain upon the principles and terms\n' +
  'stated in this Declaration of Decentralization.\n' +
  '\n' +
  '**Free TON Blockchain**\n' +
  '\n' +
  'TON is a protocol proposed and developed by Dr. Nikolai Durov. We, the\n' +
  'Free TON Developers are grateful for Nikolai’s contribution to the TON\n' +
  'protocol and wish him to continue developing it as part of a wider community\n' +
  'effort.\n' +
  '\n' +
  '  Since we believe in freedom of speech, in information sharing, and in free\n' +
  'software, we haveb decided to give the power back to the community and\n' +
  'unanimously proclaim the launch of the Free TON blockchain and the Free TON\n' +
  'Crystal (or TON for short) as its native token.The Free TON Crystal symbol\n' +
  'will be (U+1F48E): 💎\n' +
  '\n' +
  '**Why are we launching Free TON?**\n' +
  '\n' +
  'On the 3rd day of January 2009, Satoshi Nakamoto wrote the following inside\n' +
  'the Bitcoin genesis block: “Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks”,\n' +
  'and then launched the first decentralized money.\n' +
  '\n' +
  '  Today, more than 10 years later, and more than ever, it is obvious that\n' +
  'we need equal economic opportunities for The People of this world; and a new,\n' +
  '  more effective way to govern public finance — without influence from political\n' +
  'elites.\n' +
  '\n' +
  '  The protocol represents an opportunity to create a massively scalable network\n' +
  'benefiting hundreds of millions of people. Centered around smart contracts\n' +
  'with easy to use tools for developers and users, it can promote free trade,\n' +
  '  equal opportunities, censorship resistance and cooperation during\n' +
  'an unprecedented threat from a pandemic and an economic crisis.\n' +
  '\n' +
  '**Free TON is being launched in stages with the following objectives:**\n' +
  '\n' +
  '* To allow continuous debugging and development of the Free TON protocol\n' +
  '* To drive wide adoption of decentralized solutions by millions of users\n' +
  '* To accommodate future development scenarios\n' +
  '* To ensure that original protocol developers can participate once it is\n' +
  'permitted\n' +
  '* To ensure uniform development of a single network and to discourage\n' +
  'unnecessary forking\n' +
  '\n' +
  '**Free TON Decentralization**\n' +
  '\n' +
  'Free TON, launched by the principles described in this Declaration, is deemed\n' +
  'to be fully decentralized.\n' +
  '\n' +
  '  The undersigned fully understand and acknowledge that any and all services,\n' +
  '  efforts, and other commitments that they declare hereunder in support\n' +
  'of Free TON blockchain, as well as any and all TONs that they may receive\n' +
  'as a result thereof, will only be provided after Free TON is sufficiently\n' +
  'decentralized as described below. No undersigned party has promised any TONs\n' +
  'to any other party in exchange for any services except those expressly\n' +
  'described in this Declaration. Any transfer of TONs by the parties must\n' +
  'be approved through a vote by holders of TONs until Free TON decentralization\n' +
  'is achieved.\n' +
  '\n' +
  '  Under the terms of this Declaration all parties agree, declare, and commit\n' +
  'to undertake every effort possible to achieve decentralization of Free TON\n' +
  'from day one of its main network launch as described below.\n' +
  '\n' +
  '  The decentralization of a proof-of-stake blockchain network is achieved\n' +
  'on many levels: protocol governance, software development, validation stakes,\n' +
  '  user interface and so on. This is how fault tolerance, collusion deterrence\n' +
  'and censorship resistance are achieved.\n' +
  '\n' +
  '**Free TON becomes fully decentralized when:**\n' +
  '\n' +
  'A vast majority of TONs are being distributed among many users in the simplest\n' +
  'way possible in order for them to participate in staking so as to prevent any\n' +
  'single party from influencing network activities.\n' +
  '\n' +
  '  Several independent Validators are participating in network consensus; and,\n' +
  '  at least 13 independent stakes are validating masterchain and workchain blocks\n' +
  'with the requisite computer resources continuously, and such that no single\n' +
  'validator or other party that is technically able to participate in staking\n' +
  'has more than 1/3 of all TONs available.\n' +
  '\n' +
  '  Several teams of Developers are working on the protocol design, including its\n' +
  'specifications, core software, compilers, languages and interfaces.\n' +
  '\n' +
  '**Distribution of TONs**\n' +
  '\n' +
  'We have identified three groups in the community that are essential to achieve\n' +
  'Free TON Decentralization: Users, Validators and Developers. As such, all TONs\n' +
  'in genesis block (zero state) will be allocated into different predefined\n' +
  'Giver contracts. TONs held by these Givers will not participate in staking\n' +
  'or voting activities for their distribution; whereby, they shall have\n' +
  'no effect whatsoever on network decentralization properties. Each Giver\n' +
  'activity will be governed by Free TON holders by virtue of voting via a Soft\n' +
  'Majority Voting (SMV) mechanism as described below.\n' +
  '\n' +
  '**Soft Majority Voting (SMV)**\n' +
  '\n' +
  'All decisions regarding distribution of TONs from Givers will be made through\n' +
  'SMV smart contracts by current Free TON holders.\n' +
  '\n' +
  '**Referral Giver**\n' +
  '\n' +
  'A Referral Giver manages airdrops of coins to initial users through a referral\n' +
  'program that encourages the development and distribution of applications that\n' +
  'support different user segments. These Givers will receive 85% of all TONs.\n' +
  '\n' +
  '  These Givers will provide direct incentives to partners who choose to promote\n' +
  'Free TON to their user base. The referral program will be governed by a smart\n' +
  'contract that manages and validates the terms and criteria as determined from\n' +
  'time to time by Free TON holders via an SMV smart contract.\n' +
  '\n' +
  '  In order to preserve decentralization network properties, the distribution\n' +
  'of TONs from a Giver or from Givers who at the time of distribution hold/s\n' +
  'more than 30% of all TONs, to any other party or parties, is prohibited.\n' +
  '\n' +
  '**Validator Giver**\n' +
  '\n' +
  'A Validator Giver supports decentralization by providing distribution of TONs\n' +
  'to initial validators that will receive 5% of all TONs.\n' +
  '\n' +
  '  Validation in Free TON will be supported through direct validator\n' +
  'participation as well as via the DePool set of smart contracts. DePools will\n' +
  'enable further decentralization of Free TON, and therefore are highly valued\n' +
  'and encouraged. Validator Givers will distribute validator rewards through\n' +
  'Validator contests. Current Free TON holders will vote for Validator contests\n' +
  'via an SMV smart contract.\n' +
  '\n' +
  '  While Free TON has a great on-chain governance design, recent attacks on other\n' +
  'proof-of-stake blockchains proved that low level protocol solutions are not\n' +
  'sufficient enough to ensure long-term decentralization when trying to preserve\n' +
  'required network performance in proof-of-stake. A large number of users should\n' +
  'be able to participate in staking without the pitfalls of the delegated\n' +
  'proof-of-stake design, and so, without compromising network performance. The\n' +
  'decentralized staking pools initiative (DePool) is designed to optimize for\n' +
  '  decentralization in the Free TON consensus protocol. A Validator Giver will\n' +
  'support a DePool smart contract standardization by distributing additional\n' +
  'rewards to Validators who join forces in making sure validator nodes are\n' +
  'always available in DePools.\n' +
  '\n' +
  '**Developer Giver**\n' +
  '\n' +
  'A Developer Giver supports current and ongoing protocol research and\n' +
  'development, as well as network maintenance by independent teams. This reserve\n' +
  'will support developers by providing them with 10% of all TONs.\n' +
  '\n' +
  '  Continuous and coordinated work in every aspect of the core protocol, network,\n' +
  '  its architecture, and its interface designs are essential for the\n' +
  '  decentralization and support of Free TON protocol development. A clear and\n' +
  'transparent process will be established in order to involve the community\n' +
  'in Free TON development through the TIP (Free TON Improvement Proposal)\n' +
  'mechanism. TIPs are approved by the community via an SMV smart contract.\n' +
  '\n' +
  '  Developer Givers will distribute TONs to winners of TIP implementation\n' +
  'contests. Implementations will be subject to comments and critique. Winners\n' +
  'will be chosen by an SMV smart contract.\n' +
  '\n' +
  '**Caveat: No US participation**\n' +
  '\n' +
  'No US citizens or companies are permitted to sign this Declaration.\n' +
  '\n' +
  '**How You Can Contribute**\n' +
  '\n' +
  'We see large interest and support from those who want to see Free TON\n' +
  'launched. Free TON should be supported by The People in a community where\n' +
  'everybody contributes in their own way, much like Bitcoin exists today without\n' +
  'the direct contribution of its founder.\n' +
  '\n' +
  '**Soft Majority Voting**\n' +
  '\n' +
  'If members have no opinion and/or are reluctant to vote on a particular\n' +
  'decision for whatever reason, which is common, the process assumes that such\n' +
  'members are essentially neutral to or are uninterested in the subject being\n' +
  'presented. Instead of making an attempt to force neutral or uninterested\n' +
  'parties into making a decision to participate, SMV allows decisions to be made\n' +
  'by those who care the most. The metric for passing a decision is the\n' +
  'mathematical difference between the percentage of ”Yes” votes minus the\n' +
  'percentage of ”No” votes.\n' +
  '\n' +
  '  For example, if 10% of voters said Yes and no one said No, then the SMV\n' +
  'principle presumes that the decision is sufficiently supported by those who\n' +
  'care enough to vote, vis-a-vis no objections. At the same time, if all members\n' +
  'vote then the traditional simple majority rule applies, i.e., 50% +1 vote\n' +
  'means a decision is reached. When we connect those two dots on a graph with %\n' +
  'of Yes and % of No axes, we get a ”soft” simple majority threshold line. For\n' +
  'important decisions such as amendments to constitutional community documents,\n' +
  '  we can draw a «soft» super-majority threshold line. The soft majority voting\n' +
  'mechanism will be programmed on Free TON via an SMV Smart Contract.\n' +
  '\n' +
  '**Signing this Declaration**\n' +
  '\n' +
  'By signing this Declaration, the undersigned parties agree to take an active\n' +
  'role in one or several of these activities, thereby directly contributing\n' +
  'to Free TON Decentralization.\n';
